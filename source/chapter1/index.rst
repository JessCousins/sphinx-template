Angular has a rise in demand for its framework due to its support factors, which it is known for.
Angular framework also runs on all browser environments, regardless of its platforms.
Angular is reliable because it includes robust components evolved in Juxtapose and has off-the-rack tools.
Despite these advantages, Angular does have a steep learning curve and it does not consist of extensive
documentation or a clear manual. [#f6]_ The best time to use Angular is when it is required your app be compatible
with all browsers. Angular 5.0 attracted attention due to its performance boost features and server-side
rending support services. Some aspects to consider when considering the performance between Angular and
React are packaging, learning curve, model complexity, reuse of code, and templating. Angular is limited
in controlling the packaging, making Angular more rigid compared to React, which is good for slower
loading pieces of code. As previously mentioned, Angular has a steep learning curve, so it is difficult
to master; however, react has a one way data flow, making it less time consuming for developers to
understand it. Both React and Angular are good on model complexity. Angular is better with reuse of
code because Angular has a series of ready to use elements and it is always ready to employ more elements. [#f6]_
Angular is also better for templating, as templates are not reusable. Angular framework is a great option f
or building large-scale applications with many features, but if you are building light, single-page apps,
React is the better option for that. React is also faster than Angular, due to its smaller size and faster
load times on mobile. All in all, it seems as though React will be the more popular choice in 2021 according
to Google trends, but by looking at the present job market now both are worth exploring in 2021. [#f6]_
